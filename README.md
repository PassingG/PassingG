### About Me

I've studied programming for 20 years since 2016. First time I just want make game. But recently, I wanted to make a game that everyone in the world can enjoy and know. Like Nintendo.

I'm continuously exploring and actively embracing new technologies. While attending university, I participated in the project by actively accepting new technologies(Unreal4) instead of using only familiar technologies (Unity3D). This is because we can understand each of the strengths and weaknesses by experiencing various technologies and develop the ability to actively utilize the technologies that fit the right place. After graduation, I worked as a client programmer, led the casual game project, and released high-quality games within the period through smooth collaboration with the design team. Currently, C++ is used for Unreal and CSharp is used with Winform, Unity. In addition, I am interested in graphics, and I am working on self-development by conducting voluntary studies through the book "linear algebra through programmers."
